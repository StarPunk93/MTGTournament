# MTGTournament

By now it's a WIP Project.

This is gonna be a Webtool for MTG Tournaments.

The `create_database.sql` and the `cards.sql` need to be manually run on a MySQL Database.

## Python Requirements

This project is tested with Python 3.6.

To install the requirements with pip you need to run:

```pip install mysqlconnect pyramid```
