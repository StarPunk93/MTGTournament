# MTGTournament

By now it's a WIP Project.

This is gonna be a Webtool for MTG Tournaments.

The `database_create.sql` need to be manually run on a MySQL Database.
`mtg_getcards.py` gets the card Data from the API of [gatherer.wizards.com](https://gatherer.wizards.com).

## Python Requirements

This project is tested with Python 3.6.

To install the requirements with pip you need to run:

```pip install mysqlconnect pyramid pandas```
